# New-Music-Machine
The project is a sampler sequencer with powerful editting capabilities. It allows you to completely alter the sound of audio samples
and make music with it. It's inspired by KORG's hardware sampler volca sample.

Run the .py file named "sampler Final Code" to run the project. The project uses cmu_graphics and libraies numpy and scipy, which are not built-in libraries of python and need to be installed. The link for installing cmu_graphics is appended below.

Commands that are not included as instructions include:
	pressing "space" to toggle between live and edit
	pressing "up" or "down" to switch between samples

The most heavily used shortcut is using the keyboard to add and remove samples to slots, as the user can remove samples on a chunk of slots
quickly.

No fonts installation are required
